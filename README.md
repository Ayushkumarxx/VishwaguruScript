> A toy programming language where even the bugs seek moksha.

## 🧠 What is Vishwaguru Script?

**Vishwaguru Script** is a satirical, Sanskrit-flavored toy programming language designed to parody the cultural flex of "India is the Vishwaguru (world teacher)". It blends programming constructs with Sanskrit/Hindi-like keywords — not because it's efficient, but because it's *spiritually confusing*.

This language isn't here to replace Python or JavaScript — it's here to question why not.

## 🚀 Why Vishwaguru Script?

Because we Indians didn’t just invent zero.
We also invented infinite ego.

Vishwaguru Script lets you:

* Declare variables in Sanskrit-ish tones.
* Print outputs like you're chanting.
* Write loops like you're stuck in a reincarnation cycle.
* Use logic that sounds like a dharmic dilemma.

All wrapped up in satire and cultural spice.

## 🛠️ Features

### ✅ Variable Declaration:

```toh
ghoshit_kar aayu = 18;
```

### ✅ If-Else Logic (aka Karma Check):

```toh
yadi (aayu >= 18) {
  prakashit_kar("Aap vote de sakte hain");
} anyatha {
  prakashit_kar("Maaf kijiye, aap abhi chhote hain");
}
```

### ✅ Loops (prati\_ghatak):

```toh
prati_ghatak (ghoshit_kar i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1) {
  prakashit_kar("Sankhya: " + i);
}
```

### ✅ While Loop with `agla_ghaatak` and `viram`:

```toh
yatha (i < 10) {
  yadi (i == 3) { agla_ghaatak; }
  yadi (i == 8) { viram; }
}
```

### ✅ Logical Operators:

* `ca` → and
* `va` → or
* `na` → not

### ✅ Print Statement:

```toh
prakashit_kar("Jai Vishwaguru!");
```

### ✅ Error Messages:

Messages that hit harder than Indian parents' disappointment.

## 🧣 Who Should Use This?

* Developers with a sense of humour.
* Indians tired of “everything was invented in India” claims.
* People who think programming should be more *philosophical*.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a toy project.
Not meant for production, but for parody.
All offense is intentional, and all love is mutual.
Bugs are not bugs — they’re spiritual tests.

## 🧘‍♂️ Future Goals

* Add Sanskrit-style error recovery (via mantras?)
* Integrate `punarjanma()` for recursion
* Translate compiler warnings into *Upanishadic riddles*

Inspired by every Indian WhatsApp uncle who thinks we invented everything.
